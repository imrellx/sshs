## Requirements Analysis

### Issue #13: Comprehensive Tab-Based Session Management with Workspaces

**Scope**: This is a MAJOR feature that transforms sshs from a simple SSH launcher into a full workspace manager. 

**Core Requirements:**
1. **Tab System**: Multi-session management with visual indicators
   - Tab numbers: `[1:prod-web]` 
   - Activity indicators: `*` (new output), `!` (alerts), `@` (background commands)
   - Current tab highlighting
   - Add button `[+]` for new sessions
   - Tab overflow handling with scrolling
   - Tab persistence across disconnections

2. **Session Manager Overlay**: Detailed session interface with:
   - Session list with status, activity, uptime
   - Commands: Switch, Disconnect, Rename, New, Close, Quit

3. **Visual States**: Different colors/styles for active/inactive/status

4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Multiple workspaces (Production, Development, Testing)
   - Workspace switching with `Ctrl+Shift+[1-9]`
   - Tab templates and cloning
   - Tab bookmarking and recent tabs
   - Theme-based styling

5. **Command Palette**: VS Code-like interface for rapid operations

6. **Bulk Operations**: Close all disconnected, restart groups, export logs

7. **Log Management**: Auto-logging with rotation, configurable location

**Complexity Assessment**: EXTREMELY COMPLEX
- Multiple new modules needed
- Significant architecture changes
- Process management for multiple SSH sessions
- Advanced UI components

**Recommendation**: This is a 3-6 month development effort. We should break this down into smaller, manageable phases.

## Phase 2: Scope Reduction & MVP Definition

### MVP: Basic Tab Display and Switching
**Goal**: Implement minimal tab functionality without complex features

**MVP Scope (Phase 1 of Issue #13):**
1. **Basic Tab Bar**: Show current session as a tab
2. **Tab Switching**: Support 2-3 concurrent sessions 
3. **Simple Display**: `[1:hostname]` format
4. **Tab Navigation**: Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, Ctrl+3 to switch
5. **New Tab**: Ctrl+N to open new session

**Out of Scope for MVP:**
- ❌ Workspaces and workspace switching
- ❌ Activity indicators (*,!,@)
- ❌ Session manager overlay
- ❌ Command palette
- ❌ Tab persistence across restarts
- ❌ Logging and auto-naming
- ❌ Tab themes and customization
- ❌ Bulk operations

### Technical Approach
**Architecture**: Minimal changes to existing `App` struct
- Add `sessions: Vec<Session>` to track multiple SSH sessions
- Add `current_session: usize` for active session index
- Extend `ui/render.rs` to show tab bar at top
- Add `ui/tabs.rs` for basic tab management

**Session Management**: 
- Each session maintains SSH process handle and terminal state
- Simple session switching without complex state management
- Basic cleanup on session end

## Test Planning for MVP

### Test Cases for Basic Tab Functionality

**1. Tab Display Tests**
- [x] Test: Single session shows as `[1:hostname]` tab
- [x] Test: Multiple sessions show as `[1:host1][2:host2][3:host3]`
- [x] Test: Tab bar appears at top of UI
- [x] Test: Current tab is visually highlighted

**2. Tab Switching Tests**
- [x] Test: Ctrl+1 switches to first tab
- [x] Test: Ctrl+2 switches to second tab  
- [x] Test: Ctrl+3 switches to third tab
- [x] Test: Invalid tab numbers do nothing
- [ ] Test: Tab switching preserves session state

**3. New Session Tests**
- [x] Test: Ctrl+N opens host selection for new tab
- [x] Test: New session creates additional tab
- [x] Test: Maximum 3 sessions (MVP limitation)
- [x] Test: New session tab gets next available number

**4. Session Management Tests**
- [x] Test: Each session maintains independent SSH connection (basic)
- [ ] Test: Session cleanup when tab closed
- [x] Test: Switching between active SSH sessions works
- [ ] Test: Terminal output specific to each session

**5. Error Handling Tests**
- [x] Test: Failed SSH connection doesn't crash other tabs
- [ ] Test: Closing tab with active SSH handles cleanup
- [x] Test: UI gracefully handles session errors

**6. Integration Tests**
- [x] Test: Tab functionality works with existing host selection
- [x] Test: Tab switching preserves search and form states
- [x] Test: Existing single-session mode still works
