# Contributing to this Codebase

üëã Welcome! We're excited for you to contribute to this codebase.

All contributors agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/JordanForeman/.github/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Be nice and respect the maintainers' time. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Please read this whole thing. Most of this applies to any repo on GitHub. üôè

## Contribute

Code is not the only thing you can contribute. I truly appreciate contributions in the form of:

- Fixing typos.
- Improving docs.
- Triaging issues.
- Reviewing pull requests.
- Sharing your opinion on issues.

## Issues

- Before opening a new issue, look for existing issues (even closed ones).
- Don't needlessly bump issues.
- If you're reporting a bug, include as much information as possible. Ideally, include a test case that reproduces the bug. For example, a Runkit or repl.it playground. Even better, submit a pull request with a failing test.

## Pull requests

### Prerequisite

- If the changes are large or breaking, open an issue discussing it first.
- Don't open a pull request if you don't plan to see it through. Maintainers waste a lot of time giving feedback on pull requests that eventually go stale.
- Adhere to the existing code style.
- If relevant, add tests, check for typos, and add docs and types.
- Don't add editor-specific metafiles. Those should be added to your own global gitignore.
- Double-check your contribution by going over the diff of your changes before submitting a pull request. It's a good way to catch bugs/typos and find ways to improve the code.
- Do the pull request from a new branch. Never the default branch (main/master).
- Ensure that code will pass verification (eg. `npm run verify`) locally before pushing

### Submission

- Give the pull request a clear title and description. It's up to you to convince the maintainers why your changes should be merged.
- If the pull request fixes an issue, reference it in the pull request description using the syntax: `fixes #123`.

### Review

- Push new commits when doing changes to the pull request. Don't squash as it makes it hard to see what changed since the last review. I will squash when merging.
- Review the pull request diff after each new commit. It's better that you catch mistakes early than the maintainers pointing it out and having to go back and forth.
- Be patient. Maintainers often have a lot of pull requests to review. Feel free to bump the pull request if you haven't received a reply in a couple of weeks.

And most importantly, have fun! üëåüéâ
